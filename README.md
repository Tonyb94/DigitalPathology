## üìù Project Description

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This study aims to analyze and extract potential morphological biomarkers from histopathological images of surgically resected colorectal tumors from two subject groups:

- **IANG group**: patients under 40 years old (9 patients)
- **OLD group**: patients over 40 years old (8 patients)

These ultra-high-resolution images (83456 √ó 185600 pixels) were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and acquired using a Mirax scanner at Niguarda Hospital in Milan.

## üéØ Objective

The goal is to identify new tumor phenotypes and potential biomarkers using unsupervised learning techniques, based on clustering tiles from histopathological images using different feature extractors and aggregation methods.

---

## üî¨ Methodology

- Feature extraction from tumor tiles using various extractors 
  - GLCM PyRadiomics
  - MSI prediction
  - Ctranspath
- Dimensionality reduction with:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Pearson Correlation
- Feature combination across extractors
- Clustering of tumor tiles using the **Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)** technique
  - Phenotype assignment using a **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**
  - Aggregation of Patients Histogram of tiles **Dendrogram**
- Cluster evaluation using the **Silhouette score**
- Clinical interpretation and validation with an oncologist
