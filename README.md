<p align="left">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer in humans and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women, representing a significant global public health issue. The aim of this study is to analyze and attempt to extract significant biomarkers from histopathological images obtained from surgically resected colorectal tumor samples of two groups of subjects: the IANG group, under the age of 40 (9 patients), and the OLD group, over the age of 40 (8 patients). These high-resolution images, measuring (83456 Ã— 185600) pixels, were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and acquired with a Mirax scanner at the Niguarda Hospital in Milan. This thesis is inspired by the need to extract morphological biomarkers useful for precision medicine to organize appropriate and targeted treatments for patients, aiming to avoid unnecessary suffering and costs. To achieve this goal, an exploratory analysis was conducted on the clustering of patient images, based on the extraction of features using different extractors applied to the tumor tissue divided into tiles. The extracted features were then reduced in dimensionality using two techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Pearson Correlation, which were also employed to combine the different extractors. The clustering of tumor tiles was carried out using the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) technique, with a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) used to assign tumor phenotypes, in order to explore them and aggregate patients, thus identifying new potential biomarkers. The motivation behind this approach lies in the fact that some subjects in the IANG group show a therapeutic response similar to that of the OLD group. These types of analyses represent a significant challenge for precision medicine, for several reasons: H&E histopathological images are a faster and less expensive tool compared to immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR analyses; however, their interpretation and preparation involve inherent variability that can introduce diagnostic bias. Moreover, the number of expert pathologists responsible for the manual preparation and analysis of the samples has been declining for several years. Histopathological images also pose a challenge for computer vision and image processing techniques, particularly due to their extremely high resolution, which causes memory and RAM issues during processing. The clustering results of the extracted phenotypes were evaluated using the silhouette metric, which allowed for the analysis of the coherence and separation of the generated groups. These results were presented to an oncologist to compare the generated clusters with the clinical characteristics of the patients, with the goal of identifying new potential clinically relevant biomarkers</p>
